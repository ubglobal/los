## Completed Deliverables

### 1. Core Business Logic Modules (5 Modules)

#### Module 1: Workflow Engine (`includes/workflow_engine.php`)
**Lines of Code**: 350+
**Purpose**: State machine for managing Credit Approval and Disbursement workflows

**Key Functions**:
- `get_workflow_step()` - Retrieve workflow step configuration
- `get_current_step()` - Get current step for application
- `can_perform_action()` - Validate if user can perform action at current step
- `validate_transition()` - Validate workflow transition
- `execute_transition()` - Execute workflow transition with transaction safety
- `get_next_step()` - Determine next step in workflow
- `update_sla_status()` - Update SLA tracking

**Business Rules Implemented**:
- Role-based action validation from workflow_steps table
- Automatic assignment based on next step's role
- SLA calculation and tracking (On Track / Warning / Overdue)
- Stage progression (Khởi tạo → Thẩm định → Phê duyệt → Đã phê duyệt)
- Transaction-safe state changes with rollback on error
- Complete audit trail in application_history

**Integration Points**:
- Uses: workflow_steps, credit_applications, users, application_history
- Called by: process_action.php for all workflow transitions

---

#### Module 2: Facility Management (`includes/facility_functions.php`)
**Lines of Code**: 400+

## Integration with Phase 1

Phase 2 modules seamlessly integrate with Phase 1 database schema:

**Database Tables Used**:
- Phase 1: credit_applications, facilities, disbursements, approval_conditions, workflow_steps, roles, permissions, etc.
- New columns: legal_completed, effective_date, sla_status, current_step_id (from Phase 1 migrations)

**Sample Data Utilization**:
- Test users with different roles (CVQHKH, CVTĐ, CPD, GDK, Admin)
- Sample applications at different stages
- Pre-configured workflow steps
- Pre-defined permissions and role assignments

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **UI Not Updated Yet**
   - Phase 2 provides backend logic only
   - UI components needed to expose new actions
   - No disbursement detail page yet

2. **Email Notifications**
   - Workflow transitions do not send email notifications
   - Future: Add email_notifications table and send_notification() function

3. **Document Management**
   - Basic upload/delete only
   - No version control or document workflow
   - Future: Add document versioning and approval

4. **Reporting**
   - No reporting module yet
   - Future: Phase 3 or 4 should add dashboards and reports

5. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Web-only, not mobile-optimized
   - Future: Responsive design or mobile app

### Technical Debt

1. **Error Messages**
   - Some error messages in Vietnamese only
   - Future: Internationalization (i18n) support

2. **Logging**
   - Some functions log to PHP error_log, others to database
   - Future: Centralized logging system

3. **Testing**
   - No automated unit tests yet
   - Future: PHPUnit test suite

4. **API**
   - No REST API for external integrations
   - Future: RESTful API layer
